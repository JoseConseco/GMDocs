Basically, you start with some simple 2D curves that represent sewing patterns, then stitch them together. Addon turns these shapes into a mesh, which is what Blender uses to simulate the cloth. Supported Blender versions: Blender 3.6+ and 4.x. For support use Gament Tool Discord channel Garment Tool panel location: 3D Viewport > right Sidebar (N) > Garment Tool Tab. Features # sewing patterns modeling tools : symmetrize, split, flip, duplicate, stitch, connect, separate, join define stitching between patterns, directly in 3d viewport, visualize mismatched sewn segments lengths, generate evenly triangulated mesh with adjustable resolution, easy, per sewing pattern, cloth physics material assignment, automated vertex groups generation, custom bend tool for wrapping e.g. sleeves around character arms, Support for cutting holes inside sewing patterns (since 1.0.6) Pin tool for generating custom stitches (useful for buttons) Pocket tool for projecting stitches from source patterns to target pattern Bind Tool -> easy way of projecting 3d mesh, on surface of simulated cloth (useful for making attachments, bags, pockets, etc.) Garment library - store and load your creations saving baked simulation into shape-key Videos # Latest Video showing new procedural Materials and Stitches features in Garment Tool 2.1 Video showing new cloth physics presets Limitations # No interaction with simulated cloth in Blender Support for cloth interaction added in version 1.1.0 Rarely but it happens that triangulation fails to find solution for given sewing pattern. Usually increasing triangulation resolution parameters fixes that. There is now way to cut holes or add sewing cuts inside pattern. Support for cutting holes added since version 1.0.6 Installation # Edit \u2192 User Preferences \u2192 Add-ons tab, press ' Install ' button, in bottom bar. Remember to press 'Save Preferences' , so that addon stays enabled after restarting blender. When you are updating addon, usually it is good to remove old version by using 'Remove' button (visible on image above), before installing new version. Updating # The Garment Tool comes with a built-in auto updater that will automatically download and install the newest add-on release for you . To use auto updater go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Garment Tool > press Check for update . If new version is found, press [ Update addon ] button, wait few seconds and restart blender . Note: To keep the email notifications to a minimum, I release smaller updates and bug fixes without bumping up the version number. When we have enough new features or fixes, I put out a new official version with an increased version number. If you want to get the 'smaller' bugfixes but the addon says you already have the latest version, try Reinstall Current Version . This will download and install the smaller incremental bug fixes for you. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Garment Tool.

Select Preset from the list, that you want to apply to the pattern. Select cloth object and click Assign Preset: name button, Then click on the pattern in 3D Viewport. Use Enter or RMB to finish. Note - Local presets can be saved to the global library, by clicking Save Global Preset button.","title":"Local Cloth Presets"},{"location":"material_physics/#local-preset-how-they-work","text":"Local cloth presets settings are stored in current blend file. To use them in another blend file, you need to save them to the global library. Cloth settings are split into sections: Unique Properties - these properties are unique to the pattern, depending on the pattern's material. Shared Properties - these properties are shared between all patterns - no matter what material they use Note - which shared properties are used (from which local preset) is determined by sewing patterns 'Default Material' property. See Sewing Patterns for more information. This is due to the fact, that some clot properties cannot be masked with vertex groups, and some can. For example mass - cannot be masked, meaning all cloth vertices have to use same mass. The final section is for other cloth settings: simulation quality, collision settings. They are not part of the preset, but it is handy to have in one spot, together with other cloth settings.","title":"Local Preset - How they work"},{"location":"materials_library/","text":"Materials Library # Since release of Garment Tool 2.1, garments library can now be used to load cloth materials presets - above 80 materials are included in the library (free for all Garment Tool users). Material Presets First we use Blender Asset Browser to add material to the mesh, then we use Garment Tool Library to replace active material on active mesh. Library location # User Preferences > add-ons > Garment Tool > Library tab. To get materials library go to Gumroad , and navigate to your Garment Tool purchase page. In the GTool downloads section you will find zip file with the sewing patterns and material presets. Loading materials # The Materials can be added to your mesh in two ways: Click on 'Append' button from Garment Tool Library panel - this will replace active material on active object - all other instances of this material will be replaced too! By dragging and dropping material from Blender's built-in Asset Browser - this will add new material to the mesh (but all other instances of this material won't be affected). Usage # The Garment Tool material setup is quite simple - one diffuse texture is used for color roughness and bump (usually bump is done with Detail Texture though). Curvature map attribute is used, in Overlay mode, on top of diffuse to add some depth to the material. Curvature Generator can be loaded using: 'Garment Tool' tab > 'Finalize/Stitches' panel > Add Curvature Mod button. Material Presets Without Curvature Generator modifier the imported denim material looks flat Material Presets Depth Texture is used for bump effect. It is also overlaid on top of Curvature, to break curvature smooth transition look Material Presets Detail Texture - tillable texture overlaid on top of diffuse texture, to add tiny fabric detail to the material look. In Garment Tool it can be used to replace depth texture Bump map effect. Default detail texture is already included inside 'FabricShader' node, but it can be overridden with 'Use Custom Detail Texture' checkbox License # License - CAL-NA-NRB .
